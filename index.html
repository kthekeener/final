					<h1> what is in a name? </h1>

					<! Shakespeare out of Context

					I am ashamed to say my love is like
					A summer’s day. Sweet smells, it tightly clings to 
					However swift they blow away. My love, 
					It whispers to my mind in strains, in phrase
					So soft: “Two b or not two b?” it asks, and that
					Is the unanswerable, dependant on 
					The variable: what contains the essence—
					The integral core of a human soul?
					A rose by any other name: it would
					Perhaps remain the same, but would a rose 
					By any other shape or size or scent 
					Or touch possess these thorns that hurt so much?
					u varies over time and so defies 
					The reason and rhyme of the human race.
					The integral part is not in names—places—faces
					To be or not is not the question.
					What’s in a name? Nay, give me a soul and
					Lay bare the essence, though it be rough hewn.
					Let me love like a complex equation
					For a summer’s day passes swift away.>
