We. 
	Web. 
		We are <a> thing which prioritizes the mind. Eyes and hands forget that they belong to flesh. 
		We are <a> thing which forgets the 
			<body>, collapses distance into a strand-- 
				The illusion of <a> humanity freed from the chains of distance, 
					now only constrained by <time> 
						and <a> bank of memory external to our individuality, 
							like <a> 
							<legend> written in bits. 
			We are <a> part of this entity, 
				<a> new network of electric impulses laid across the 
				<span>of the sea.
				A mind across the <map>,
					transatlantic <progress> 
						as <small> steps to 
						<a> transhuman end. 
		Once, our bodies were our <code>, 
			<a> 
			<template> for language, 
				<a> record of religion, 
					the <thread> of geneology 
					<tracking> back to dust. 
		I pray with my hands still. I watch fingertips tap out <a> meditation, 
			but the rest of my <form> does not know itself,
			and eyes cannot remind my other senses to remember their Maker or remember how to love. They have no <object> of affection.
Blessed are those who believe without seeing, Christ declared as Thomas touched his side.
